Real-estate-bc : A Blockchain-based Real Estate Tokenization and Management System


Description
Real-estate-bc is a blockchain-based real estate management system that leverages smart contracts to facilitate the management and fractional ownership of real estate properties. The system allows property owners to tokenize their real estate assets into NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) and further fractionalize them into ERC-1155 tokens. This enables multiple investors to own fractions of a property, making real estate investment more accessible and liquid. The system also provides a DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) for managing the properties and making decisions collectively for shared assets, as well as rent distribution and charge management functionalities.
